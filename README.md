##### I made customized skewed carousel i got inspired from [FormSoftware official website](https://www.fromsoftware.jp/jp/).  <br> 

Animation using framer-motion. Its very quick to make cool effects. I made this project simply for practicing stying and animating components. Further implementation will be added if viable. <br> 

### BUGS:
+ i dont know why at the beginning it glitches. 
+ no responsive. I wont make responsive for mobile and ipad
+ some numbers are fixed. I cant find other ways, if you figure it out, do share your solutions!
